# Initial access

The initial access is done through Word Macro. Do not forget to put it into Document and not into Template.
**rev.ps1** should contain your PS1 reverse shell, such as Nishang's (https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1).

Use my dedicated guide for Macro here : [[LINK ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID GUIDE, BECAUSE SHARED WITH OTHER EXAM SETS]]
